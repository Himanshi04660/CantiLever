Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing of text data.
Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Implementation of multiple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
Evaluation of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
-> Python 3.x
-> Pip (Python package manager)

Results:
The performance of each model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
